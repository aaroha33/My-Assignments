# My-Assignments

a. Your client ABC (manuf_data) came with an ask that they donâ€™t have visibility of the sales on retailer platforms(retailer_data). Reason there is no unique key mapping       product of ABC to its product being sold on retailer (retailer example-Amazon). In the absence of a common primary key, you are left with descriptions to do the mapping. You need to use the description of ABC (manuf_data) and description of its product on retailer platform(retailer_data) to do the mapping
b.	Map all the retailer product to top 3-4 best possible match on ABC side. Use any NLP technique to the achieve the objective
c.	Things to keep in mind- we have not provided any training data- please create one if needed, clearly comment your code
